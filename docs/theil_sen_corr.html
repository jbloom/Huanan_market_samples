   <h2>
    Overall correlation of mitochondrial DNA and SARS-CoV-2 across all samples using Theil-Sen estimator
   </h2>
   <p>
    Each point shows the correlation between the percent of all high-quality reads that align
to SARS-CoV-2 and the percent of aligned mitochondrial reads for a specific species taken
across all samples. The axes show the Spearman correlation and a
    <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-correlation-measure-based-on-theil-sen-regression-31b8b9ed64f1">
     measure of correlation based on the Theil-Sen estimator
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    A critical aspect of this plot is the choice of what scale is used to
calculate the correlations. The choices, which are adjustable using the options below
the plot, are:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Quantify the mitochondrial reads is as the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads that map to the mitochondrial genome of that species, or as the percent of reads that align to any chordate mitochondrial genome that align to that species.
    </li>
    <li>
     Whether the axis scales show the raw percentages or the log10 of the percentages. When using a log scale, percentages of zero are set to half the lowest observed percentage across all samples and species.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The options at bottom allows you to show correlations computed only over samples
collected on specific dates, isolated from particular sources, or that contain at least one
SARS-CoV-2 read.
   </p>
   <p>

    <em>

    boxes allow you to click on a specific species to
highlight in a red box on the plot.
