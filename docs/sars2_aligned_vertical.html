    Percent of high-quality reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 in each metagenomic sample (vertically oriented plot)

   <p>
    For each metagenomic sample, this plot shows the percent of all high-quality reads (reads
that passed  pre-processing) that align with sufficiently high mapping quality
to SARS-CoV-2. Points are colored according to the date that sample was collected.
   </p>
   <p>
    Click on points in the

    legend to subset only to samples
collected on specific dates, and use the dropdown to select samples isolated from
particular sources. Mouseover points on the plot for details about individual samples.
