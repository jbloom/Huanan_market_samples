    Overall correlation of mitochondrial DNA and SARS-CoV-2 across all species
   </h2>
   <p>
    Each point shows the correlation between the percent of all high-quality reads that align
to SARS-CoV-2 and the percent of aligned mitochondrial reads for a specific species taken
across all samples. The axes show the Pearson and Spearman correlations.
   </p>
   <p>
    The options at bottom allows you to show correlations computed only over samples
collected on specific dates or isolated from particular sources.
   </p>
   <p>
    The axis scale selection enables switching between correlations computed using
the percentages or the log percentages
computed after adding a pseudocount of 0.5.
