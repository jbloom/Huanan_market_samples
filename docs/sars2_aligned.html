    Percent of high-quality reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 in each metagenomic sample
   </h2>
   <p>
    For each metagenomic sample, this plot shows the percent of all high-quality reads (reads
that passed  pre-processing) that align with high mapping quality
to SARS-CoV-2. Points are colored according to the date that sample was collected.
   </p>
   <p>
    Click on points in the
    <em>
     Collection date
    </em>
    legend to subset only to samples
collected on specific dates, and use the dropdown to select samples isolated from
particular sources. Mouseover points on the plot for details about individual samples.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that the y-axis uses a symlog scale.
