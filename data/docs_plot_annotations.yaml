# some information for the index page
index_title: Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of environmental samples from the Huanan Seafood Market
index_abstract: |
  Analysis by Jesse Bloom of the SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial DNA content of metagenomic samples collected in early 2020
  from the Huanan Seafood Market by [Liu et al (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06043-2),
  with the data taken from [NGDC project CRA010170](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA010170).

  The metagenomic content of some samples was also analyzed by
  [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0).

  crits_christoph_vs_current_run_corr:
    title: Correlation of read counts aligned to mitochondria of different species in current study vs Crits-Christoph et al
    legend: |
      For each sequencing run analyzed by [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0),
      this plot shows the Pearson correlation in the counts of aligned mitochondrial reads in the current study
      versus Table S3 of Crits-Christoph et al across all species in that table.

      You can mouseover the points for details, and use the sliders at the bottom of the plot to
      adjust how many total aligned mitochondrial reads in each study are required for a run
      in order for it to be shown in this plot.

  mito_composition:
    title: Composition of mitochondrial DNA in each sample for all chordates and just mammals
    legend: |
      For individual samples (which can be selected using the dropdown box below the pie charts), this
      plot shows the percentage of aligned mitochondrial reads that map to each species as determined
      in the current study. Pie charts are shown for all chordates and just mammals.

      For the samples also analyzed in 
      [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0), there are also
      pie charts showing the mitochondrial DNA composition determined in that study
      for all species in Table S3 of
      Crits-Christoph et al, and for all species plotted in Figure 1 of Crits-Christoph
      et al (note Table S3 of their paper reports counts only for mammals, and Figure 1 of
      their paper only plots counts for a subset of these mammals).
      
      Use the clickable legend below the plot to show some of these species sets.

      Mouseover the pie slices for more details about counts for individual species,
      as well as the total number of high-quality reads (passing `fastp` pre-processing)
      and the number of reads that align to SARS-CoV-2.

  genomic_contig_composition:
    title: Composition of genomic contigs in each sample
    legend: |
      This plot shows the composition of contigs that align to the genome (or transcriptome
      as alignments allow splicing) for each sample. Currently only calculated for sample Q61,
      which is the only sample for which such data are shown in
      [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0).

      Mouseover the pie slices for more details about the counts for individual species.
  
  sars2_aligned:
    title: Percent of high-quality reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 in each metagenomic sample
    legend: |
      For each metagenomic sample, this plot shows the percent of all high-quality reads (reads
      that passed `fastp` pre-processing) that align with high mapping quality
      to SARS-CoV-2. Points are colored according to the date that sample was collected.

      Click on points in the *Collection date* legend to subset only to samples
      collected on specific dates, and use the dropdown to select samples isolated from
      particular sources. Mouseover points on the plot for details about individual samples.

      Note that the y-axis uses a symlog scale.

  sars2_aligned_vertical:
    title: Percent of high-quality reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 in each metagenomic sample (vertically oriented plot)
    legend: |
      For each metagenomic sample, this plot shows the percent of all high-quality reads (reads
      that passed `fastp` pre-processing) that align with high mapping quality
      to SARS-CoV-2. Points are colored according to the date that sample was collected.

      Click on points in the *Collection date* legend to subset only to samples
      collected on specific dates, and use the dropdown to select samples isolated from
      particular sources. Mouseover points on the plot for details about individual samples.

      Note that the y-axis uses a symlog scale.
  
  per_species_corr_faceted:
    title: Correlation of mitochondrial composition with SARS-CoV-2 reads for all species
    legend: |
      Correlation across all samples
      between the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads
      that align to SARS-CoV-2 versus the percent that align to the mitochondrial genomes for
      the indicated species.
      The orange numbers give the Pearson correlation coefficient.

      A critical aspect of this plot is the choice of what scale is used to plot the numbers
      and calculate the correlations. The choices, which are adjustable using the options below
      the plot, are:

        - Quantify the mitochondrial reads is as the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads that map to the mitochondrial genome of that species, or as the percent of reads that align to any chordate mitochondrial genome that align to that species.
        - Whether the axis scales show the raw percentages or the log10 of the percentages. When using a log scale, percentages of zero are set to half the lowest observed percentage across all samples and species.

      Other at the bottom of the plot enable:
      
        - Selection of samples only from specific collection dates (click on circles next to select).
        - Selection of only samples collected from particular sources.
        - Selection of samples only with a sufficient number of total aligned mitochondrial reads.
        - Selection of only samples containing at least one SARS-CoV-2 read.

      Mouseover points for details on particular samples.

      The correlation coefficients will change accordingly if you select different options for
      how the percent mitochondrial reads is computed or whether we analyze the direct or log10
      percents.
    
  per_species_corr_single:
    title: Correlation of mitochondrial composition with SARS-CoV-2 reads for individual species
    legend: |
      Correlation across all samples
      between the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads
      that align to SARS-CoV-2 versus the percent that align to the mitochondrial genomes for
      the indicated species.
      The orange numbers give the Pearson correlation coefficient.

        - Which species to show.
        - Selection of only samples containing at least one SARS-CoV-2 read.

      Mouseover points for details on particular samples.

      The correlation coefficients will change accordingly if you select different options for

  overall_corr:
    title: Overall correlation of mitochondrial DNA and SARS-CoV-2 across all species
    legend: |
      Each point shows the correlation between the percent of all high-quality reads that align
      to SARS-CoV-2 and the percent of aligned mitochondrial reads for a specific species taken
      across all samples. The axes show the Pearson and Spearman correlations.

      A critical aspect of this plot is the choice of what scale is used to
      calculate the correlations. The choices, which are adjustable using the options below
      the plot, are:

        - Quantify the mitochondrial reads is as the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads that map to the mitochondrial genome of that species, or as the percent of reads that align to any chordate mitochondrial genome that align to that species.
        - Whether the axis scales show the raw percentages or the log10 of the percentages. When using a log scale, percentages of zero are set to half the lowest observed percentage across all samples and species.

      The options at bottom allows you to show correlations computed only over samples
      collected on specific dates, isolated from particular sources, or that contain at least one
      SARS-CoV-2 read.
      
      The *species to highlight* boxes allow you to click on a specific species to
      highlight in a red box on the plot.

      This plot is modeled on that shown in Figure 4A of the original
      [Liu et al (2022) Research Square](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1370392/v1_covered.pdf)
      pre-print.
