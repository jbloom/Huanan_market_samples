# some information for the index page
index_title: Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of environmental samples from the Huanan Seafood Market
index_abstract: |
  Analysis by Jesse Bloom of the SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial DNA content of metagenomic samples collected in early 2020
  from the Huanan Seafood Market by [Liu et al (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06043-2),
  with the data taken from [NGDC project CRA010170](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA010170).

  The metagenomic content of some samples was also analyzed by
  [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0).

  This page links to interactive plots of key results:

  crits_christoph_vs_current_run_corr:
    title: Correlation of read counts aligned to mitochondria of different species in current study vs Crits-Christoph et al
    legend: |
      For each sequencing run analyzed by [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0),
      this plot shows the Pearson correlation in the counts of aligned mitochondrial reads in the current study
      versus Table S3 of Crits-Christoph et al across all species in that table.

      You can mouseover the points for details, and use the sliders at the bottom of the plot to
      adjust how many total aligned mitochondrial reads in each study are required for a run
      in order for it to be shown in this plot.

  mito_composition:
    title: Composition of mitochondrial DNA in each sample for all chordates and just the mammals analyzed in Crits-Christoph et al
    legend: |
      For individual samples (which can be selected using the dropdown box below the pie charts), this
      plot shows the percentage of aligned mitochondrial reads that map to each species. Pie charts
      are shown just for the species (mammals) analyzed in
      [Crits-Christoph et al (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZDNVv-zMLX0) and for all
      chordates as analyzed in the current study. Note that the read counts are all as determined
      in the current study, and "Chrits-Christoph et al" refers to their set of species,
      not their read counts. 
      
      You can use the dropdown below the plot to also show just one of these species sets.
      to also show just one of these species sets.

      Mouseover the pie slices for more details about counts for individual species.
  
  sars2_aligned:
    title: Percent of high-quality reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 in each metagenomic sample
    legend: |
      For each metagenomic sample, this plot shows the percent of all high-quality reads (reads
      that passed `fastp` pre-processing) that align with sufficiently high mapping quality
      to SARS-CoV-2. Points are colored according to the date that sample was collected.

      Click on points in the *Collection date* legend to subset only to samples
      collected on specific dates, and use the dropdown to select samples isolated from
      particular sources. Mouseover points on the plot for details about individual samples.

      Note that the y-axis uses a symlog scale.
  
  per_species_corr_faceted:
    title: Correlation of mitochondrial composition with SARS-CoV-2 reads for all species
    legend: |
      Each panel shows the correlation between the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads
      that align to SARS-CoV-2 and the percent of all aligned mitochondrial reads that are from
      that species across all samples. The orange numbers give the squared Pearson correlation coefficient.

      The options at the bottom allow you to select samples only from specific collection dates
      (click on the circles for those dates), only samples isolated from particular sources, or only
      samples with a sufficient number of total aligned mitochondrial reads.

      The axis scale selection enables switching between the percentages or the log percentages
      computed after adding a pseudocount of 0.5.

      Mouseover points for details on particular samples.
    
  per_species_corr_single:
    title: Correlation of mitochondrial composition with SARS-CoV-2 reads for individual species
    legend: |
      The correlation between the percent of all high-quality (preprocessed) reads
      that align to SARS-CoV-2 and the percent of all aligned mitochondrial reads that are from
      that species across all samples. The orange numbers give the squared Pearson correlation coefficient.

      The options at the bottom allow you to select which species to show,
      select samples only from specific collection dates
      (click on the circles for those dates), only samples isolated from particular sources, or only
      samples with a sufficient number of total aligned mitochondrial reads.

      The axis scale selection enables switching between the percentages or the log percentages
      computed after adding a pseudocount of 0.5.

      Mouseover points for details on particular samples.

  overall_corr:
    title: Overall correlation of mitochondrial DNA and SARS-CoV-2 across all species
    legend: |
      Each point shows the correlation between the percent of all high-quality reads that align
      to SARS-CoV-2 and the percent of aligned mitochondrial reads for a specific species taken
      across all samples. The axes show the Pearson and Spearman correlations.

      The options at bottom allows you to show correlations computed only over samples
      collected on specific dates or isolated from particular sources.
      
      The axis scale selection enables switching between correlations computed using
      the percentages or the log percentages
      computed after adding a pseudocount of 0.5.

      The *species to highlight* boxes allow you to click on a specific species to
      highlight in a red box on the plot.

      This plot is modeled on that shown in Figure 4A of the original
